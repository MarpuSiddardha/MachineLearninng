Image Segmentation helps to obtain the region of interest (ROI) from the image. It is the process of separating an image into different areas. The parts into which the image is divided are called Image Objects. ... The goal of image segmentation is to simplify the image for better analysis.

A time series dataset is different. Time series adds an explicit order dependence between observations: a time dimension. This additional dimension is both a constraint and a structure that provides a source of additional information. A time series is a sequence of observations taken sequentially in time.
